| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage Only**: All user data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage
- **No Data Transmission**: No user data is sent to external servers
- **Encryption Support**: Optional client-side encryption for sensitive data
- **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized before processing

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers to prevent unauthorized script execution
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all form inputs
- **File Upload Security**: CSV imports are validated for file type, size, and content

### Browser Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented to prevent XSS and other injection attacks
- **Security Headers**: 
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- **HTTPS Ready**: Application is designed to work securely over HTTPS

### Code Security
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits of npm dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling to prevent information disclosure
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for critical operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Privacy Protection

### No Tracking
- No analytics or tracking code
- No cookies used for tracking
- No external API calls for data collection
- No fingerprinting techniques

### Data Minimization
- Only essential data is stored
- Optional fields remain optional
- Users can delete their data at any time
- No automatic data retention policies

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Responsible Disclosure
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to the maintainer with details
3. Allow reasonable time for assessment and fixes
4. Provide clear reproduction steps if possible

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Browser Security
- Keep your browser updated to the latest version
- Use browsers with strong security features
- Consider using privacy-focused browsers
- Enable automatic security updates

### Device Security
- Use updated operating systems
- Enable device encryption
- Use strong device passwords/PINs
- Log out of shared/public computers

### Data Protection
- Regularly export your data as backup
- Be cautious when importing data from external sources
- Verify CSV files before importing
- Consider using private/incognito browsing mode

## Security Architecture

### Client-Side Security
```
User Input → Validation → Sanitization → Processing → Storage
     ↓           ↓            ↓            ↓         ↓
   Forms    Validators   Security      Error    LocalStorage
            Rules       Manager      Handler   (Encrypted)
```

### Content Security Policy
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data:;
font-src 'self';
connect-src 'none';
object-src 'none';
frame-src 'none';
```

### Input Validation Layers
1. **Client-side validation**: Immediate feedback
2. **Security sanitization**: XSS/injection prevention
3. **Business logic validation**: Data integrity
4. **Type validation**: Correct data types
5. **Range validation**: Acceptable value ranges

## Development Security

### Code Review Process
- All code changes require review
- Security-focused review for sensitive changes
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Regular dependency updates

### Testing
- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for data flow
- Manual security testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Deployment Security
- Build process validation
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Secure deployment practices

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **GDPR Principles**: Privacy by design and default
- **Security by Design**: Built-in security from the ground up

### Regular Assessments
- Monthly dependency audits
- Quarterly security reviews
- Annual penetration testing (if applicable)
- Continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities
